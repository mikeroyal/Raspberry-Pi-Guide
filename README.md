## Setting Watchdog Timer (WDT) on Raspberry Pi
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/raspberry-pi-Guide#table-of-contents)

[Watchdog Timer (WDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer) is a timer that monitors microcontroller (MCU) programs to see if they are out of control or have stopped operating.

### Installing and enabling WDT service

To enable watchdog you have to change the boot parameters by adding **dtparam=watchdog=on** in **/boot/config.txt** using a text editor such as nano, vim, gedit, etc.. Also, install watchdog package and enable it to start at startup. Also, make sure to restart your Raspberry Pi for these settings to take effect.

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install watchdog```

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $sudo systemctl enable watchdog```

### Configure WDT service

Configuration file for watchdog can be found in **/etc/watchdog.conf**. 

```
max-load-1 = 24
watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
realtime = yes
priority = 1
```

**To start the WTD service:**

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl start watchdog```

**Check watchdog status:**

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl status watchdog```

**To stop the service:**

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl stop watchdog```

## Rust Learning Resources

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. Rust has a comparable amount of runtime to C and C++, and has set up its standard library to be amenable towards OS development. Specifically, the standard library is split into two parts: core and std. Core is the lowest-level aspects only, and doesn't include things like allocation, threading, and other higher-level features.

Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety, type safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel.
